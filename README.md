Admin Dashboard In PHP

The Admin Dashboard In PHP is a simple project developed using PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. The project contains only an admin side.
The admin does all the work like adding products, amount, editing the details, or deleting the product, vendor, and categories. 
The admin has to login first. This project makes a convenient way for the store/inventory admin to keep the records of products in a proper way.
